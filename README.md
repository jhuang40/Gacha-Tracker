# Project Proposal

## What will the application do?
This application is a gacha tracker. This will allow users to track and plan there time 
in gacha games. A gacha game is a game where a player spends stamina(rechargable energy system) in order to get 
resources in order to improve there current account. So this will track how much time and stamina a player has to 
spend on a given gacha in order to obtain the desired resources. Examples of gacha games include: Fate/Grand Order,
and Arknights. It also allows users to keep track of of how much they have done in a gacha game.

## Who will use it?
People who play these gacha games could use this application in order to plan there time and resources
. This tool would greatly increase the efficiency at which players obtain resources and the greatly reduce 
planning time for players.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
This project is interesting to me because I spend a lot of time playing gacha games and I often find it
difficult to find good resources online to help me with my planning. So I hope that this application
will be useful to both me and people in the gacha game community.

## User Stories
- As a user I want to be able to create a material
- As a user I want to be able to see how much time it takes to get an x amount of resources and how much stamina it takes
- As a user I want to be able to see how much stamina and time it takes to get a specific set of materials
- As a user I want to be able to make a set of materials
- As a user I want to be able to add sets of materials to the total list of materials that I have used
- As a user I want to be able to see how many materials I have ever used
- As a user I want to be able to save my current total 
- As a user I want to be able to load my current total

## Phase 4:Task 2
I have chosen the "Test and design a class in your model package that is robust.  You must have at least one method that throws a checked exception.  You must have one test for the case where the exception is expected and another where the exception is not expected.
" Option for phase 4. I have made the SetOfMaterials class more robust by 
throwing an exception if the index of my remove method is outside of the size of the array.

## Phase 4:Task 3
If I had more time to work on this project in terms of design I would not make any changes, because
the structure of this project is very simple.
